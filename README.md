1. Vary now takes five arguments, with the fifth input corresponding to the exponential rate of variance. You can either pass "LINE" or "EXPO" as the fifth parameter, which would corresponding to a linear or exponential rate of variance, respectively.
2. The user would now be able to specify the desired shading models used when producing images and animations. 
    The syntax would be as follows: *shading shader_mode*, where the *shader_mode* could either be flat or phong.
