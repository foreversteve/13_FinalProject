# Features to Implement

1. Vary can now take five arguments, with the fifth input corresponding to the exponential rate of variance. If only four arguments are given, it will be the same vary as we currently have. 
2. The user would now be able to specify the desired shading models used when producing images and animations. 
    The syntax would be as follows: shading shader_mode
   The possible shader_modes would include: flat, phong, and possibly Gourad.
